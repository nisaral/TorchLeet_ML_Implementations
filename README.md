## TorchLeet-ML-Implementations
A collection of PyTorch implementations for TorchLeet problems, additional ML/DL models, and research paper reproductions.

# Structure

torchleet/: Implementations of TorchLeet problems (Easy, Medium, Hard).
additional_models/: Custom implementations of models like ResNet, Attention, Diffusion.
research_papers/: Implementations of seminal ML papers.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and experiments.
scripts/: Training and utility scripts.

# Setup
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TorchLeet-ML-Implementations.git
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
   Run a specific implementation:
python torchleet/easy/linear_regression/linear_regression.py

# Plan

Implement one TorchLeet problem per day.
Study related theory and implement additional models (e.g., ResNet, Transformers).
Reproduce research papers (e.g., "Attention Is All You Need").
